## My process

### Built With

- **Semantic HTML5 Markup:** Utilizing semantic elements to enhance the structure and clarity of the HTML code.

- **CSS3:** Leveraging the power of CSS custom properties for maintainability, along with Flexbox for efficient and responsive layout design.

- **JavaScript (ES6):** Implementing ES6 features to enhance the interactivity and functionality of the project.

- **Mobile-First Workflow:** Adopting a mobile-first approach during development to ensure a seamless and optimized experience on various devices and screen sizes.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained valuable insights into:

- Effectively using semantic HTML5 markup.
- Leveraging CSS custom properties and Flexbox for responsive design.
- Applying a mobile-first workflow to optimize user experience.

These learnings contribute to my ongoing growth as a frontend developer.

### Continued Development

While working on this project, I faced challenges when styling the `summary::markers`. Specifically, adjusting their appearance and positioning proved to be tricky. With the valuable guidance from MDN's documentation on the [details element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) and insightful assistance from ChatGPT, I successfully overcame these obstacles.

Below is an example of the CSS code used to style the `::before` pseudo-element for the `summary`:

```css
summary::before {
    content: '';
    background: url('../images/icon-plus.svg') no-repeat center right;
    background-size: contain;
    width: 30px;
    height: 30px;
    position: absolute;
    right: 0;
    left: 113%;
}
```

Moving forward, I aim to explore more advanced techniques for enhancing user interface elements and refining my skills in CSS styling.
